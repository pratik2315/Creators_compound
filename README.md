Many of us work extensively on a new video idea and work on it for weeks but upon publishing the video we find very few views
are generated on our video :( Youtube's algorithm works in mysterious ways and therefore its important for each and every creator
to learn basic SEO and marketing skills. Our App provides a platform where new people are introduced to the mundane idea of Search
Engine Optimization.

Creators should always take inspiration from whats happening from around the world. One of the way to make it to the Trending section
is to create maximum number of videos from trending content. This increases your chances of being found quickly on the search bar.
Our app fetches data from trusted servers and shows them to the user helping them stay up to date about world news.

Creators can also reach out of Video editors by gmail and network with them.
